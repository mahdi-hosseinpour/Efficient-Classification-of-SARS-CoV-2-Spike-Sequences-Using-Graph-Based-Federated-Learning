# Efficient-Classification-of-SARS-CoV-2-Spike-Sequences-Using-Graph-Based-Federated-Learning
## Overview
The rapid mutation of SARS-CoV-2 necessitates accurate and efficient variant
classification to support timely public health responses. In this study, we present an advanced
federated learning (FL) framework that enables privacypreserving and decentralized
classification of SARS-CoV-2 variants without requiring direct data sharing between
institutions.
By leveraging distributed data analysis, our approach ensures that local datasets remain
confidential while still contributing to the global modelâ€™s learning process. To further
improve classification performance, we incorporate Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into
the FL architecture. GNNs are particularly effective for modeling complex relationships in
protein sequence data, allowing for more accurate variant identification. This hybrid
approach not only enhances the predictive power of the model but also maintains data
security and integrity across multiple research centers. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves 93.26% accuracy in classifying SARS-CoV-2 variants,
outperforming several traditional machine learning approaches. Additionally, the framework
is designed to be scalable, making it suitable for large-scale genomic studies and real-world
pandemic monitoring applications. By integrating federated learning and deep graph-based
representations, our model offers a robust, adaptable, and privacy-focused solution for
genomic data analysis, contributing to more effective tracking of viral mutations and aiding
global health initiatives.
