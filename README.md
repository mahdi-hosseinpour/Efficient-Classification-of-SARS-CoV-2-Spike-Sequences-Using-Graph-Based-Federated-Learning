# Efficient-Classification-of-SARS-CoV-2-Spike-Sequences-Using-Graph-Based-Federated-Learning
Overview
In this repository, we present an advanced federated learning (FL) framework that enables privacy preserving and decentralized classification of SARS-CoV-2 variants without requiring direct data sharing between institutions.
